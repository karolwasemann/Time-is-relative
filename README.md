### Purpose of exercise

Action cinema has taken Einstein's theory of relativity to heart and neatly plays with the concept of the passage of time. Time goes faster, slower, stands still, moves - we have experienced all of this many times on cinema screens. Let's see how you handle the logic of such turbulence.

Your tasks:

1. add logic for counting the elapsed time in seconds since entering the page

2. Add support for time speed multiplier using + and - buttons
3. disable the ability to set -1, 0, 1 in the multiplier (go from -2 to 2 immediately)
4. Add logic that takes into account the multiplier in the time rate
5. Add the ability to stop/resume the elapse of time using the Stop/Start buttons
